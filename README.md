# Cannalysis
I am currently employed by a medical cannabis dispensary in Morrilton, AR. I started in January and quickly fell in love with the industry after further seeing the impact it has on people medically. I was interested in the job after seeing a listing because I have multiple close people in my life that have directly benefited from cannabis, medically. Something I find super cool is the endocannabinoid system, and how terpenes impact effects of cannabis. This data analysis project will display ten popular strains of marijuana, their dominant terpene, and the grow time of one plant in weeks. I hope to spark your interest in this unfairly stigmatized subject.
